##Research Experiences


_*Oct 2015-present*_



**International School of Software, Wuhan University**, Wuhan, China


***Improving cell-cycle stage recognition from single-cell transcriptome data by deep learning networks Research Assistant***, Advisor: Professor Feng LIU from International School of Software, Wuhan University
> * Raised the computational method’s accuracy on cell cycle stage recognition by 20% through adopting RNN and DNN (deeplearning networks) compared to traditional machine learning methods (SVM, Random Forest, PCA).

>* Selected gene features by PCA method instead of database-based method (such as the features selected by text mining orexperiments), since PCA method could reveal the internal structure of the data.

>*  Verified the feasibility of implementing deep learning methods (RNN&DNN) on the transcriptome data, it was the first time that deep learning methods used on transcriptome data, and it was hopeful to implement on other problems (cell types, sub-population).


_*Apr 2015-Mar 2016*_




**School of Health Science, Wuhan University**, Wuhan, China

***The exploration on implementing wearable devices and smart phones for warning and treatment for fatal heart disease Research Assistant***, Advisor: Professor Qiqiang HE School of Health Science Wuhan University

> * Made an imitation of diagnostic procedure conducted by doctors by combining the data gathered by wearable devices with dailyquestionnaires since the data from the sensors was limited.


>* Improved the survival rate of the patients by warning the doctors and the relatives of the patients when they are in fatal condition

>* Recognized the fatal condition by sensors and interaction with patients, if sensors detect no pulse and the patient did not response to the device.
